## ⚠️ Thanks for coming, but first...~~let's take a selfie!🤳🏻~~
You will need to ensure that the React Native development environment is working correctly. If you haven't already, I suggest taking a look [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) before continuing.

## ⚛️ About the project 
The intent of this project is to provide a custom template for React Native developers that wishes to start a brand new application, not by the begin, but having a pre-built project with the most commons and populars libraries and a reasonable pattern for the folder hierarchy.

## 🤔 How many different libraries do we have?

 - [@react-navigation/native](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) → Provide a powerful, easy to use and completely customizable screens navigation in React Native;
 - [@react-navigation/stack](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator) → Provide a stack navigation model to use on react navigation;
 - [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) → "Promise based HTTP client";
 - [formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/guides/react-native) → Helper to build forms in react/react-native easily;
 - [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) → "Used as runtime type checking for React props and to document the intended types of properties passed to components";
 - [react-native-masked-text](https://github.com/benhurott/react-native-masked-text) → "This is a simple masked text (normal text and input text) component for React-Native";
 - [react-native-safe-area-context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) → "A flexible way to handle safe area", is something like a better version of SafeAreaView;
