## Thanks for coming, but first...~~let's take a selfie!~~
You will need to ensure that the React Native development environment is working correctly. If you haven't already, I suggest taking a look [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) before continuing.

## About the project
The intent of this project is to provide a custom template for React Native developers that wishes to start a brand new application, not by the begin, but having a pre-built project with the most commons and populars libraries and a reasonable pattern for the folder hierarchy.

## How many different libraries do we have?
